Advancements in development, integration, deployment environments and operational paradigms have led to a desire for an alternatve for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP).
This document defines the architecture for the RESTful Provisioning Protocol (RPP) an HTTP based provisioning protocol leveraging the REST architectural style and JSON data-interchange format, aiming to standardize a RESTful protocol for provisioning database objects. The architecture includes support for extensibility, allowing for multiple possible use cases. RPP is intended to co-exist with EPP, offering an alternative protocol including data model compatibility with EPP core objects and the benefits associated with the REST architectural style and widely adopted HTTP-based technologies.

== Introduction

This document outlines the architecture of the RESTful Provisioning Protocol (RPP). RPP aims to provide a modern, standardized, and developer-friendly protocol for provisioning and managing objects in a shared database or registry, initially focusing on functional equivalents of EPP object mappings for domain names <<RFC5731>>, hosts <<RFC5732>>, and contacts <<RFC5733>>. RPP also considers provisioning of other object as a potential use case, aiming for a uniform API layer for various registry operations.

RPP is designed to leverage the benefits of REST (REpresentational State Transfer), including statelessness, ease of integration, and compatibility with existing web infrastructure and tooling such as OpenAPI, API gateways, and web application firewalls. By adopting JSON as the data-interchange format, RPP seeks to align with current development practices and the successful deployment patterns observed in protocols such as RDAP <<RFC9082>>. The choice for REST and JSON also facilitates direct browser and mobile application integration including modern security mechanisms such as OAuth2.0.

This architecture document serves as a foundation for a series of specifications that will collectively define RPP. It details the layered approach, core components, and design considerations for building an interoperable and extensible provisioning protocol. RPP is intended to coexist with EPP, offering an alternative for implementers seeking a RESTful approach without aiming to replace EPP or define migration paths from EPP. RPP aims for data model compatibility with EPP core objects to allow automatic and mechanical mapping and conversion, especially for core objects (domain, contact, host).

== Terminology

This document uses terminology from RFC5730 <<RFC5730>> and broadly adopts the REST architectural principles as defined in [REST] and related RFCs.

*  **RPP:** RESTful Provisioning Protocol. The protocol being defined by the RPP working group.

*  **EPP:** Extensible Provisioning Protocol as defined in <<RFC5730>>.

*  **REST:** REpresentational State Transfer architectural style <<REST>>.

*  **JSON:** JavaScript Object Notation <<RFC8259>>.

*  **JWT:** JSON Web Token <<RFC7519>>.

* **OpenAPI:** The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) (formerly known as Swagger Specification) is an API description format for REST APIs <<OpenAPI>>.

* **RPP client:** An entity or application that interacts with the RPP server to perform provisioning operations, such as creating, updating, or deleting resources.

== Requirements
This document is based on the requirements defined by RPP WG in state from 7.3.2025 <<RPPReq>>.

The actual state of the requirements is present on WG Wiki https://wiki.ietf.org/en/group/rpp/requirements.


== Architectural Overview
This chapter provides an overview of the RESTful Provisioning Protocol (RPP) architecture. A key design principle is to leverage existing web standards and principles, particularly HTTP and REST principles. This allows RPP to delegate functionality and features to the well-established infrastructure and semantics of the web, focusing its own definitions on the specific domain of object provisioning. Therefore, we assume:

* **HTTP and RESTful principles are foundational:** RPP leverages HTTP for transport and adheres to RESTful principles for resource management.
* **Domain-specific logic resides in data representations:** The specifics of resource provisioning are encoded within the data structures and semantics of the RPP message bodies.
* **Layered architecture for modularity:** The architecture is layered to promote modularity, separation of concerns, and independent evolution of different aspects of the protocol.

The architecture is divided into three main layers: **HTTP Transport**, **Data Representation**, and **Resource Definition**. Each layer defines specific aspects of the protocol. This layered approach allows for clear separation of concerns.

**Data Structure** is a sub-layer of Data Representation and described later in this document. It focuses on the structure of RPP messages.

Similarily **Data Elements**, their **Mapping** onto Data Structure and **Operations** are elements of Resource Definition. They focus on the semantic structure of RPP resources and transformation of those resources.

[[resource-oriented-architecture]]
=== Resource Oriented Architecture
RPP adopts a Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA), aligning with RESTful principles. This approach defines all manageable entities as "resources," identified by unique URLs. Operations on these resources are performed through a uniform interface using the standard HTTP methods and their semantics. This contrasts with RPC-style protocols, which often define new and specific operations with custom parameters. ROA promotes a more standardized and interoperable approach, leveraging the existing web infrastructure and its well-defined semantics. Key aspects of ROA within RPP include:

* **Resource Identification:** Each resource is uniquely identifiable by a URL.
* **Uniform Interface:** HTTP methods (HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) are used to perform operations on resources in a consistent manner.
* **Operation Singularity** Operations, excluding collection retrieval, are defined to target a single resource. Operations intended to affect multiple resources, such as bulk operations (a single command applied to multiple resources) or command sets (multiple commands on multiple resources), should be modeled through dedicated "batch" or "bulk operation" resources.
* **Representation:** Resources can be represented in various formats (e.g., JSON, XML) through HTTP standard content negotiation.
* **Statelessness:** Each request to a resource is treated as independent of previous requests. The server does not maintain client state between requests.
* **Cacheability:** Responses can be cached to improve performance.

=== Architecture Layers
[[http-transport-layer-overview]]
==== HTTP Transport Layer

This layer defines the transport mechanism for RPP messages, utilizing HTTP as the underlying protocol. 

It encompasses aspects such as:

* **Authentication and Authorization:** Mechanisms for verifying the identity of clients and controlling access to resources.
* **Resource Addressing using URLs:** Consistent and meaningful URL structures for identifying, accessing resources and enable request routing.
* **Mapping of basic operations to HTTP uniform interface (verbs):** Mapping CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to POST, HEAD/GET, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE respectively.
* **Mapping of operations beyond HTTP uniform interface to URLs and verbs:** Handling more complex operations through appropriate URL structures and HTTP methods.
* **Asynchronous Operation Management:** Facilitating the handling of operations that are not completed immediately, by defining an HTTP-based interaction pattern for status checking and deferred result retrieval.
* **RPP specific error codes and relation to HTTP error codes:** Defining RPP-specific error codes while relating them to standard HTTP error codes for consistency.
* **Transaction tracing and idempotency:** Mechanisms for tracking requests and ensuring idempotent operations where appropriate.
* **Caching:** Leveraging HTTP caching mechanisms to improve performance.
* **Content negotiation for media types:** Supporting multiple data representation formats and using content negotiation to select the appropriate format.
* **Versions and profiles:** Support signalling of versions of RPP protocol and other protocol elements as well as defining sets of protocol elements and their versions in form of profiles.
* **Language negotiation for textual content:** Supporting multiple languages for textual content and using language negotiation to select the appropriate language.
* **Definition of special resources:** Defining specific resources for service discovery, metadata retrieval, etc.
* **Service discovery mechanisms:** Mechanisms for clients to discover available RPP services.

==== Data Representation Layer

This layer focuses on the data representation of RPP messages. It defines the media type used to carry RPP data and supports various data representation formats.

It encompasses aspects such as:

* **Data structure:** Defining the structure and schema of the RPP data, potentially using a specific schema language.
* **Data format:** Defining the specific format used to represent RPP data within the representation (e.g., JSON, XML or JWT).
* **Media Type definition:** Defining the specific media type to be used in RPP, including any constraints on the data format and structure

==== Resource Definition Layer
This layer defines the structure and operations for each resource type, independent of media type or representation. It ensures resources are well-defined and allows for easy extensibility and compatibility with different media types.

It encompasses aspects such as:

* **Data elements:** Defining the individual data elements that make up a resource, including their data types, formats, and any constraints.
* **Resource type definitions:** Defining the structure of specific resource types by combining data elements.
* **IANA registry definitions:** Potentially registering resource definitions with IANA for standardized and automated processing.
* **Mapping of data elements to media types:** Defining how the data elements of a resource type are represented in different media types (e.g., JSON, XML).
* **Extension mechanisms:** Providing mechanisms for creating new resource types and for extending existing resource types with new data elements or operations including potentially new response status codes.

== Protocol Details

This section provides further details on each layer of the RPP architecture.

[[http-layer-details]]
=== HTTP Transport Layer Details

The RPP architecture uses the best practices described in <<RFC9205>> for the HTTP transport layer.

[[authentication-authorization]]
==== Authentication and Authorization

RPP is aimed to leverage scalable and modern authorization standards, with a focus on OAuth 2.0 <<RFC6749>> and related frameworks, however it should also support other authentication schemes defined for HTTP, an example would be HTTP Basic Authentication which might be required for compatibility with existing EPP systems. RPP should be able to support future authentication and authorization standards defined for HTTP.

Specifications will define profiles for:

*  HTTP Authentication schemes (e.g., HTTP Basic Authentication, Bearer Token <<RFC6750>> etc.)
*  Authorization frameworks (e.g., OAuth 2.0 <<RFC6749>>)

Implementations will be able to choose authentication and authorization methods appropriate for their security requirements.

===== Authorization Scopes

RPP specifications will standardize authorization scopes (like rpp:read or rpp:write) to define granular access control for different usage scenarios. These scopes will be defined for various operations and resource types, ensuring that clients can be granted only the necessary permissions.

===== Fine-Grained Authorization

RPP authorization models may become fine-grained, extending beyond simple auth-code based models used EPP. Authorization decisions will be able to consider the specific operation being performed (e.g., update vs. read), the resource being accessed (e.g., a specific domain name), and potentially even attributes within the resource. 

Here solutions like OAuth2 RAR <<RFC9396>> could be considered to provide fine-grained access control.

===== Relationship between clients and authentication credentials

RPP authentication and authorization model will make a clear distinction between the login credentials and the authorization to act in context of a given RPP client. More than one credential might be authorized to act on behalf of the same RPP client. The same credential however must be always assigned to one and only one RPP client context.

In case of HTTP Basic Authentication, one user-id is always bound to at most one RPP client. For OAuth, the issued token is bound to the context of at most one RPP client, even though the OAuth client itself might have access to multiple RPP clients. The assignment of tokens to specific RPP clients can be controlled through the authorization flow using the OAuth scope parameter. For example, if an OAuth client has access to two RPP clients (Client A and Client B), the scope parameter can specify which client the token applies to. A scope value like `scope=rpp:clientA` would ensure the token is valid only for Client A, while `scope=rpp:clientB` would apply to Client B.

===== Security

RPP will not explicitely define security related policies related to authentication or authorization (such as password complexity, token lifetime or cryptography used) on the protocol level. Instead, these properties will be delegated to the best practices of the chosen authentication schemes, which may evolve over time and would have to be independet of the protocol itself.

==== Resource Addressing

RPP resources are addressed using URLs. Considerations include:

* Hierarchical URL structure to represent resources of different type (e.g., `/domains/{domain-name}`, `/contacts/{contact-id}`).
* URL structure to represent list of related resources (e.g., `/domains/{domain-name}/contacts/`)

RPP URL structure will be designed to be human-readable, intuitive, and RESTful, allowing clients to easily navigate and interact with resources.

RPP would not require all URLs to be hard wired to server's RPP root URL. Instead, it would allow for relative URLs to be defined and discovered by the client. This would allow servers to distibute resources across multiple servers and URLs and allow for easier scaling as described in <<RFC9205>>.

As a matter of extensibility consideration RPP should allow for additional path segments to be added to the URLs and be discoverable by clients.

===== Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)

RPP will address the handling of Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) in resource addressing. Specifications will define whether to use IDN or UTF-8 encoding directly in URLs and whether to employ redirects to canonical URLs or "see-also" linking for alternative representations. For example,  a "see-also" link could point from a UTF-8 encoded URL to an IDN URL and vice versa, allowing clients to use either URL. Another way would be to always redirect to the canonical URL, which would be the IDN URL.

==== Mapping of basic operations to HTTP uniform interface (verbs)

RPP operations are mapped to standard HTTP methods to leverage the
uniform interface and RESTful principles:

*  **HEAD:**  Retrieve resource state (e.g., retrieving domain existence information). This may be a candidate for equivalence of EPP check command, however it may come with few caveats to consider:
  -  EPP check is intended to check whether domain registration is possible. This is not semantically the same as resource state. Overloading HEAD with EPP semantics may lead to confusion, especially that some frameworks implicitely implement HEAD out or GET handling.
  -  a better equivalence of EPP check would be a POST with Expect header
*  **GET:**  Retrieve resource state (e.g., retrieving domain or contact information) - EPP info command
*  **POST:** Create a new resource (e.g., registering a domain or create contact object) - EPP create command
*  **PUT:**  Update an existing resource in its entirety (e.g., updating domain registration details) - not 100% equivalent of EPP update command
*  **DELETE:** Delete a resource (e.g., deleting a domain registration) - EPP delete command
*  **PATCH:**  Partially modify a resource (e.g., updating specific attributes of a domain or contact) - EPP update command

EPP transfer commands (query and transform), being in fact a representation of a running process, may be modelled by a subresource `/transfer` of the resource being transferred, with a PUT operation to initiate the transfer, GET operation to query the transfer status and POST operation to approve or reject the transfer. The same approach may apply when adding any other process to the resource, like domain restore.

EPP check command may be modelled either as a GET operation with a dedicated media type, a POST operation with Expect header or a HEAD verb - depending on the specific requirements of the check operation.

Other transform operations like renew, or restore which are not addressable resources in terms of REST may be either also modelled as POST requests with a dedicated media type, or be a convention of URLs with processing resources with only POST interface starting with underscore, e.g. `/domains/{domain-name}/_renew`.

This basic set of rules and guidelines will be further refined in the RPP specifications and give an universal toolset for extending RPP with new resources and commands.

==== Asynchronous Operation Processing
The RPP architecture accommodates operations that are potentially long-running or cannot be completed synchronously due to their nature (e.g., acting on multiple objects, resource-intensive tasks, or processes involving manual steps). This is achieved by leveraging standard HTTP mechanisms to provide an asynchronous interaction pattern. This pattern allows a client to initiate an operation and receive an immediate acknowledgment, with the means to check the operation's status and retrieve its outcome at a later point.

The typical interaction flow facilitated by the architecture is as follows:
1.  A client initiates an operation via an HTTP request.
2.  For operations processed asynchronously, the server typically responds immediately with an appropriate HTTP status code and an indication of a status resource where the client would be able to obtain result of the operation. The resource may be dedicated to the specific performed operation, be a subresource of the resource being processed, or be a separate message queue resource with a stream of operation results.
3.  The server may also provide additional signalling in the response to indicate the expected time for completion or other relevant information using standard HTTP mechanisms.
4.  The representation of the status resource reflects the operation's progress. Once the operation concludes, this representation indicates the final outcome, providing either the results directly, links to the results, or detailed error information in line with RPP's error reporting principles. It shall remain up to protocol design for certain operation and server policy which granularity of status information shall be offered. In some cases it might be sufficient to have one final message, in other cases intermediate statuses might be required. The lifetime of these resources might be also differentiated. Messages in the queue would exist until they are read out by the RPP client. Other status resources might exist for a specific time defined by the server after the processing reached its final state. Finally resources might virtually exist forever or require an explicit delete operation from the client.

This architectural approach to asynchronous operations allows client applications to remain responsive and manage extended processing times effectively, contributing to the overall scalability and robustness of interactions within the RPP ecosystem. Specific RPP operations intended for asynchronous execution will be designed to utilize this pattern.

==== RPP specific status codes and relation to HTTP status codes

RPP utilizes HTTP headers for transferring HTTP and RPP status codes, using the standard HTTP headers and RPP-specific HTTP headers. The response body may contain machine readable problem details. Using HTTP status codes and headers allows the client or an intermediate to determine what action to take based on status code only.

*  Use of HTTP status codes to indicate general status categories (e.g., 2xx success responses, 4xx for client errors, 5xx for server errors) <<RFC7231>>.
*  Use of additional signalling already standardised for HTTP, for example for rate limiting
*  Definition of RPP-specific status codes, warnings or additional processing information, provided in the response, preferably outside of resource representation (e.g. in HTTP Headers) to give granular information about provisioning request status. 
* RPP-specific status codes will be defined in a way that allows for easy mapping to HTTP status codes, but also provide additional information specific to RPP operations.
* The HTTP status code is used to determine if the outcome of a request is successful or not.
* Categorization of RPP status codes as temporary or permanent to guide client retry behavior.

==== Transaction tracing and idempotency
RPP shall support identification of requests and reponses on both client side and server side with use of client provided identifiers  and server provided identifiers. This will allow for tracking of requests and responses in case of errors, and for idempotency of requests. This should be defined outside of the Data Representation Layer (e.g. as HTTP Headers), to assure clear separation of resourse representation from performed actions. If possible existing mechanisms of HTTP shall be employed.

==== Caching
RPP shall benefit from HTTP standard caching mechanisms to enable standard components like proxies and caches to improve performance and reduce load on servers. RPP shall define caching policies for different resources and operations, including cache-control headers and ETag support.

==== Content negotiation for media types

RPP supports content negotiation to allow clients to specify preferred media types for request and response payloads using the HTTP 'Accept' and 'Content-Type' headers <<RFC7231>>.

*  Support for 'application/rpp+json' as the primary media type.
*  Potential support for other media types defined in the Data Representation Layer

==== Protocol Versioning
RPP will define a versioning schema for the protocol itself, the extensions and other protocol elements such as profiles as appropriate. The versioning schema shall on one side allow for independent introduction of new features in a non-breaking manner on both client and server side, and on the other side allow the opposite party of the communication to determine if the version is compatible or not.
One of potential approaches having this property might be use of Semantic Versioning <<SemVer>>, but also other versioning schema shall be possible.

Signalling of the versions will be preferrably realised using parameters of the media type.

==== Profiles
In the real operational conditions different RPP server operators may have different requirements regarding set of protocol elements and their versions necessary to be supported by the client to enable reliable communication. Such requirements may be also defined by external policies. For this purpose RPP will define a concept of profiles, being identifiers translated into a certain minimum configuration of protocol version, extensions and their versions. The profiles themserves will be versioned same way as other protocol elements.

RPP may define a machine-readible definition of profiles to allow automatic processing by the clients, but may also refer to other form of profile specification.

Signalling of the profiles will be preferrably realised using parameters of the media type.

==== Prefer Header for Response Verbosity

RPP may utilize the HTTP `Prefer` header <<RFC7240>> with the "return" preference to allow clients to control the verbosity of responses. For example, clients not interested in full resource representations could use `Prefer: return=minimal` to request minimal responses, reducing payload sizes and improving efficiency. The default behavior, without the `Prefer` header, would be to return a full resource representation, similar to object info responses in EPP, especially after compound requests are completed.

==== Language negotiation for textual content

RPP shall support language negotiation to enable clients to request
responses in a preferred language using the HTTP 'Accept-Language'
header <<RFC7231>>.

* Server implementations MAY support multiple languages for
textual content in responses to provide human-readable localized responses.
* The default language and mechanisms for indicating supported
languages will be defined, preferably using HTTP methods, like OPTIONS or HEAD requests.
* application/rpp+json media type may support multi-language representations, especially for witing operations involving user provided content. Other media types may have different mechanisms for language representation.

==== Definition of special resources

RPP may define special resources for specific purposes:

*  Service Discovery endpoints to advertise protocol capabilities
and supported features (see <<service-discovery>>).
*  Metadata endpoints to provide schema information or other
protocol-level metadata, potentially including OpenAPI definitions for documentation and code generation.

[[service-discovery]]
==== Service discovery mechanisms

RPP will define mechanisms for service discovery, allowing clients
to dynamically discover RPP service endpoints and capabilities, reducing coupling between clients and servers.

*  Potential discovery of RPP server location, like  IANA bootstrappping document or a special DNS TXT RR with location of RPP service for the tld.
*  Potential use of well-known URIs (e.g., `/.well-known/rpp-capabilities`) for service discovery.
*  Advertising supported protocol versions,
extensions, available resource types, authentication methods, and supported features.
*  It may be considered for RPP to distribute service discovery for each resource type separately for better scalability and management. For example instead of having a single service discovery endpoint for the whole registry on `/.well-known/rpp-capabilities` there might be a separate discovery placed under `/{resource-type}/.well-known/rpp-capabilities` e.g. `/domains/.well-known/rpp-capabilities`.
*  Service discovery shall utilize standardised methods, like URI templates <<RFC6570>> to allow easy navigation of resources and avoid hard-coding of URLs.

=== Data Representation Layer

This layer focuses on the data representation of RPP messages. It defines the media type used to carry RPP data and supports various data representation formats.

==== Data structure
RPP will define the overall structure of the message payload carried
by the chosen media type. By default one data structure will be defined, however RPP should be able to support multiple data structures, especially for compatibility with EPP and other standards.

*  **'RPP' Structure:**  Defining a new, dedicated data structure
specifically for RPP messages. This would be the default in core specifications.

Other future possibilities:

*  **'EPP' Structure Adaptation:**  Reusing or adapting to the existing EPP XML schemas, to maintain data model compatibility with EPP core objects and simplify mapping from EPP.
*  **'JSContact' Structure Adaptation:**  Adapting to the existing JSON representation for Contact Information <<RFC9553>>, to maintain alignment with RDAP.
*  **'VC' Structure Adaptation:**  Adapting to existing Verifiable Credentials (<<W3C-VC>>, <<I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc>>) data structures, especially for representing identity or authorization information, allowing for integration with external identity systems.

==== Data format
The primary format for RPP data represetations shall be JSON, however RPP should be able to be extended to support other formats like XML, JWT, JWT-SD or CBOR.

* **JSON:** Standard JSON format <<RFC8259>>. 
* **XML:** eXtensible Markup Language <<XML>> (considered for potential compatibility with EPP).
* **JWT:** JSON data encapsulated within a JSON Web Token <<RFC7519>> for potential use-cases when verifiable data consistency is required 
* **JWT-SD:** JSON data with Selective Disclosure using JWTs <<I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt>> for minimisation of exposed data. 
* **CBOR:** Concise Binary Object Representation for specific use cases requiring compact binary encoding <<RFC8949>>.

Some data formats can be optionally represented in other encapsulations, for example JSON data can be represented also in JWT or CBOR. Change of encapsulation shall not affect the data structure. This might be beneficial if RPP is to be extended to support different data formats in the future that only require additional properties provided by encapsulation, like signing, encryption or binary representation.

==== Media Type definition
Together data structure and data format would define the whole media type. So application/rpp+json would be the primary media type with "rpp" payloads in plain json format. application/epp+xml would be epp payload as per <<RFC5730>>. 

=== Resource Definition Layer
Each resource type, no matter if on a top level, being an independent provisioning object, or a subresource, being a part of another resource, shall be well defined including data elements and possible operations. A respource definition shall on the first level of abstraction be composable out of data elements, without any reference to the media type or representation. This will allow for easy extensibility and compatibility with different media types.

All resource types shall be defined in IANA registry in a way that allows fully automated processing of the resource definition, including data elements, operations and media type representation.

==== Data Elements
This part defines logical data elements for each resource type, which can also be re-used across resource types. It is abstracted from the actual transport and media type, focusing on the structure and constraints of data elements. Data element definition includes:

*  Identification of logical data units (e.g. a stable identifier of a data element, which is independent of the representation)
*  Definition of logical data units (e.g., domain name, contact details)
*  Format and schema for primitive data elements or reference to other resource type definitions
*  Constraints on data elements (e.g., data type, length, allowed values)
*  Mechanisms for extensibility, if applicable

Data elements shall be defined in IANA registry in a way that allows for automated processing of the data element definition, including constraints and references to other data elements.

==== Mapping
This layer defines the mapping of Data Elements onto the Data Representation Layer. For example in case of application/rpp+json media type, the mapping layer would define how the logical data units are represented in JSON format.

This additional level of indirection would allow usage of data formats defined outside of rpp specifications - for example usage of Verifiable Credentials or Verifiable Presentations as first class resource types for contacts in RPP, and mapping appropriate data elements.

The mapping layer shall be defined in IANA registry in a way that allows for automated processing of the mapping definition, including reading and writing operations. Mechanisms, such as defined for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Patch <<RFC6902>>, may be used to define the mapping.

==== Operations
Each resource type shall define operations possible on this resource type. This may encompass any of the mechanism defined on the HTTP transport layer and be constrained by those extensibility rules. 

Operations shall be defined in IANA registry in a way that allows for automated processing of the operation definition, including constraints and references to other resource types.

=== Extension mechanisms
The RPP architecture is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new resource types, data elements, and operations without breaking existing implementations. This extensibility is achieved through:

* **Layered Design:** Each architectural layer (HTTP Transport, Data Representation, Resource Definition) is defined independently, allowing new features or technologies to be introduced at one layer without impacting others.
* **IANA Registries:** Resource types, data elements, mappings, and operations are registered in IANA registries using machine-readable formats. This enables automated processing, discovery, and extension of protocol elements without requiring changes to the core specifications.
* **Resource and Operation Extension:** New resource types and operations can be defined and registered. Existing resources can be extended with additional data elements or operations in a backward-compatible manner.
* **Profile and Compatibility Layers:** Compatibility profiles can be defined to support subsets of RPP for specific use cases (such as EPP compatibility)
* **Discovery and Negotiation:** Service discovery endpoints and content negotiation mechanisms allow clients and servers to dynamically discover and utilize new capabilities, resource types, and representations as they are introduced.
* **Status codes:** New RPP status codes can be defined and registered including their mapping to HTTP status codes.

These extensibility mechanisms ensure that RPP can evolve to meet future requirements, integrate with emerging technologies, and support a wide range of provisioning scenarios while maintaining interoperability and stability.
