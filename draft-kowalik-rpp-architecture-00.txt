                            RPP Architecture
                   draft-kowalik-rpp-architecture-00

Abstract

   The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), standardized in 2009, has
   served the domain name industry well for domain name management.
   However, advancements in development, integration, and operational
   paradigms have led to a desire for a provisioning protocol leveraging
   the REST architectural style and JSON data-interchange format.  This
   document defines the architecture for the RESTful Provisioning
   Protocol (RPP), aiming to standardize a REST-based protocol for
   provisioning services, initially focused on domain name, host, and
   contact management, while allowing for future extensibility.  RPP is
   intended to co-exist with EPP, offering a modern alternative
   benefiting from the REST architectural style and widely adopted
   technologies.  RPP aims for data model compatibility with EPP core
   objects.

1.  Introduction

   The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) [RFC5730] has been a
   cornerstone protocol for domain name management.  Recognizing the
   shift towards RESTful architectures and the widespread adoption of
   JSON, this document outlines the architecture of the RESTful
   Provisioning Protocol (RPP).  RPP aims to provide a modern,
   standardized, and developer-friendly protocol for provisioning
   services, initially focusing on functional equivalents of EPP for
   domain names [RFC5731], hosts [RFC5732], and contacts [RFC5733].  RPP
   also considers DNS provisioning as a potential use case, aiming for a
   uniform API layer for various registry operations.

   RPP is designed to leverage the benefits of REST, including
   statelessness, ease of integration, and compatibility with existing
   web infrastructure and tools such as OpenAPI, API gateways, and web
   application firewalls.  By adopting JSON as the data-interchange
   format, RPP seeks to align with current development practices and the
   successful deployment patterns observed in protocols like RDAP
   [RFC9082].  The choice of REST and JSON also facilitates direct
   browser and mobile application integration.

   This architecture document serves as a foundation for a series of
   specifications that will collectively define RPP.  It details the
   layered approach, core components, and design considerations for
   building an interoperable and extensible provisioning protocol.  RPP
   is intended to coexist with EPP, offering an alternative for
   implementers seeking a RESTful approach without aiming to replace EPP
   or define migration paths from EPP.  RPP aims for data model
   compatibility with EPP core objects to allow automatic and mechanical
   mapping and conversion, especially for core objects (domain, contact,
   host).

2.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from RFC5730 [RFC5730] and broadly
   adopts the REST architectural principles as defined in [REST] and
   related RFCs.

   *  *RPP:* RESTful Provisioning Protocol.  The protocol being defined
      by the RPP working group.

   *  *EPP:* Extensible Provisioning Protocol as defined in [RFC5730].

   *  *REST:* REpresentational State Transfer architectural style
      [REST].

   *  *JSON:* JavaScript Object Notation [RFC8259].

   *  *JWT:* JSON Web Token [RFC7519].

   *  *JWT-SD:* JWT with Selective Disclosure
      [I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].

   *  *OpenAPI:* The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) (formerly known as
      Swagger Specification) is an API description format for REST APIs.

3.  Requirements

   Note: This list of requirements is based on the current (20.2.2025)
   state of discussion in RPP working group and may be changed in futher
   work [RPPReq].

   RPP is designed to meet the following requirements:

   *  *RESTful Architecture:* The protocol MUST adhere to REST
      architectural principles, targeting at least level 2 of the
      Richardson Maturity Model.

   *  *JSON Data Format:* The protocol MUST use JSON as the primary
      data-interchange format for request and response payloads.

   *  *Functional Equivalence to EPP:* RPP SHOULD provide functional
      equivalents for core EPP functionalities related to domain names,
      hosts, and contacts as defined in [RFC5731], [RFC5732], and
      [RFC5733].  Mappings for core objects (domain, contact, host) and
      a selection of commonly used EPP extensions will be provided in
      separate specifications.

   *  *EPP Data Model Compatibility:* RPP aims for data model
      compatibility with the existing EPP data model for core objects
      (domain, contact, host) to allow automatic/mechanical mapping/
      conversion between EPP and RPP.  Compatibility definitions for RPP
      to EPP mappings may be defined in compatibility profiles.

   *  *Extensibility:* The protocol MUST be extensible to accommodate
      new functionalities, data objects, and operations beyond the
      initial scope.

   *  *Security:* RPP MUST employ strong authentication and utilize
      encrypted transport (HTTPS) to protect sensitive data and
      authentication material.  Security mechanisms SHOULD be flexible

Internet-Draft              rpp-architecture                  March 2025


      to allow operators to choose appropriate methods and support
      federated authentication scenarios.  RPP authorization models are
      intended to be fine-grained and go beyond simple auth-code based
      models, allowing for control at the operation and potentially
      attribute level, supporting use cases like domain transfers, DNS
      provider authorizations, and renewals.

   *  *Interoperability:* The protocol MUST promote interoperability
      between different implementations to reduce integration costs and
      encourage broader adoption.

   *  *Leverage Web Standards:* RPP SHOULD leverage widely deployed web
      standards, tools, and infrastructure components such as HTTP,
      JSON, OpenAPI, API gateways, and load balancers.

   *  *Internationalization:* The data model MUST have support for
      internationalization, including for Contact objects (potentially
      drawing from RDAP JSContact), email addresses, and
      Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs).  RPP should also support
      human-readable localized responses.

   *  *Profiles:* RPP MUST allow for the use of different profiles to
      indicate required parts of the data model, mapping definitions, or
      functional subsets for compatibility.  Profiles may be indicated
      using MIME type headers or other mechanisms.

   *  *Bulk Operations, Listing and Filtering:* RPP SHOULD allow for
      common bulk operations, resource listing, and filtering
      capabilities.

   *  *Data Omission Signaling:* RPP SHOULD provide mechanisms for
      registrars to signal data omission, indicating data collected but
      not transmitted to the registry.

   *  *Expanded Common Models:* RPP's data model SHOULD aim for easy and
      natural extensibility to richer models compared to EPP, including
      attributes for VAT numbers, company numbers etc.

   *  *Registrant Verification:* RPP SHOULD consider mechanisms to
      support data formats outside of core RPP domain.  Especially
      formats, which lose their properties if transformed, like
      Verifiable Credentials for contacts which are digitally signed.

   *  *Service Discovery:* RPP MUST support service discovery to reduce
      coupling between clients and servers, potentially using well-known
      URLs.

Internet-Draft              rpp-architecture                  March 2025


   *  *Documentation:* RPP specifications SHOULD include OpenAPI
      definitions to facilitate documentation, testing, and code
      generation, and provide implementer-friendly extension
      descriptions.

4.  Architectural Overview

   This chapter provides an overview of the Resource Provisioning
   Protocol (RPP) architecture.  A key design principle is the maximal
   reuse of existing web standards, particularly HTTP and REST
   principles.  This allows RPP to leverage the well-established
   infrastructure and semantics of the web, focusing its own definitions
   on the specific domain of resource provisioning.  Therefore, we
   assume:

   *  *HTTP and RESTful principles are the foundation:* RPP leverages
      HTTP for transport and adheres to RESTful principles for resource
      management.

   *  *Domain-specific logic resides in data representations:* Only the
      specifics of resource provisioning are encoded within the data
      structures and semantics of the RPP message bodies.  The
      underlying transport and general resource handling are handled by
      standard web technologies.

   *  *Layered architecture for modularity:* The architecture is layered
      to promote modularity, separation of concerns, and independent
      evolution of different aspects of the protocol.

   The architecture is divided into three main layers: *HTTP Transport*,
   *Data Representation*, and *Resource Definition*. Each layer defines
   specific aspects of the protocol.  This layered approach allows for
   clear separation of concerns, enabling independent evolution and
   extensibility of each layer.

4.1.  Resource Oriented Architecture

   RPP adopts a Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA), aligning with
   RESTful principles.  This approach treats all manageable entities as
   "resources," identified by unique URLs.  Operations on these
   resources are performed through a uniform interface using HTTP
   methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH).  This contrasts with RPC-
   style protocols, which often define specific operations with custom
   parameters.  ROA promotes a more standardized and interoperable

Internet-Draft              rpp-architecture                  March 2025


   approach, leveraging the existing web infrastructure and its well-
   defined semantics.  Key aspects of ROA within RPP include:

   *  *Resource Identification:* Each resource is uniquely identifiable
      by a URL.

   *  *Uniform Interface:* HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
      are used to interact with resources in a consistent manner.

   *  *Representation:* Resources can be represented in various formats
      (e.g., JSON, XML) through content negotiation.

   *  *Statelessness:* Each request to a resource is treated as
      independent of previous requests.  The server does not maintain
      client state between requests.

   *  *Cacheability:* Responses can be cached to improve performance.

4.2.  Architecture Layers

4.2.1.  HTTP Transport Layer

   This layer defines the transport mechanism for RPP messages,
   utilizing HTTP as the underlying protocol.

   It encompasses aspects such as:

   *  *Authentication and Authorization:* Mechanisms for verifying the
      identity of clients and controlling access to resources.  Standard
      HTTP authentication mechanisms are preferred.

   *  *Resource Addressing using URLs:* Consistent and meaningful URL
      structures for identifying and accessing resources.

   *  *Mapping of basic operations to HTTP uniform interface (verbs):*
      Mapping CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to POST,
      GET, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE respectively.

   *  *Mapping of operations beyond HTTP uniform interface to URLs and
      verbs:* Handling more complex operations through appropriate URL
      structures and HTTP methods.

   *  *RPP specific error codes and relation to HTTP error codes:*
      Defining RPP-specific error codes while relating them to standard
      HTTP error codes for consistency.

   *  *Transaction tracing and idempotency:* Mechanisms for tracking
      requests and ensuring idempotent operations where appropriate.

Internet-Draft              rpp-architecture                  March 2025


   *  *Caching:* Leveraging HTTP caching mechanisms to improve
      performance.

   *  *Content negotiation for media types:* Supporting multiple data
      representation formats and using content negotiation to select the
      appropriate format.

   *  *Language negotiation for textual content:* Supporting multiple
      languages for textual content and using language negotiation to
      select the appropriate language.

   *  *Definition of special resources:* Defining specific resources for
      service discovery, metadata retrieval, etc.

   *  *Service discovery mechanisms:* Mechanisms for clients to discover
      available RPP services.

4.2.2.  Data Representation Layer

   This layer focuses on the encapsulation and data representation of
   RPP messages.  It defines the media type used to carry RPP data and
   supports various data representation formats.

   It encompasses aspects such as:

   *  *Data structure:* Defining the structure and schema of the RPP
      data, potentially using a specific schema language.

   *  *Data format:* Defining the specific format used to represent RPP
      data within the representation(e.g., JSON, XML).

   *  *Data encapsulation:* Optionally defining encapsulation mechanisms
      for the data format (e.g., JWT, CBOR).

   *  *Media Type definition:* Defining the specific media type to be
      used in RPP, including any constraints on the data format and
      structure

4.2.3.  Resource Definition Layer

   This layer defines the structure and operations for each resource
   type, independent of media type or representation.  It ensures
   resources are well-defined and allows for easy extensibility and
   compatibility with different media types.

   It encompasses aspects such as:

Internet-Draft              rpp-architecture                  March 2025


   *  *Data elements:* Defining the individual data elements that make
      up a resource, including their data types, formats, and any
      constraints.

   *  *Resource type definitions:* Defining the structure of specific
      resource types by combining data elements.

   *  *IANA registry definitions:* Potentially registering resource
      definitions with IANA for standardized and automated processing.

   *  *Mapping of data elements to media types:* Defining how the data
      elements of a resource type are represented in different media
      types (e.g., JSON, XML).

   *  *Extensibility mechanisms on the resource type level:* Providing
      mechanisms for extending resource types with new data elements or
      operations.

5.  Protocol Details

   This section provides further details on each layer of the RPP
   architecture.

5.1.  HTTP Transport Layer Details

5.1.1.  Authentication and Authorization

   RPP is aimed to leverage scalable and modern authorization standards,
   with a focus on OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] and related frameworks, however
   it should also support other authentication schemes defined for HTTP,
   like HTTP Basic Authentication which might be required for
   compatibility with existing EPP systems.  RPP should remain open to
   support future authentication and authorization standards defined for
   HTTP.

   Specifications will define profiles for:

   *  HTTP Authentication schemes (e.g., HTTP Basic Authentication,
      Bearer Token [RFC6750])

   *  Authorization frameworks (e.g., OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749])

   Implementations will be able to choose authentication and
   authorization methods appropriate for their security requirements.

Internet-Draft              rpp-architecture                  March 2025


5.1.1.1.  Authorization Scopes

   RPP specifications will standardize authorization scopes to define
   granular access control for different usage scenarios.  These scopes
   will be defined for various operations and resource types, ensuring
   that clients can be granted only the necessary permissions.

5.1.1.2.  Fine-Grained Authorization

   RPP authorization models will be fine-grained, extending beyond
   simple auth-code based models used EPP.  Authorization decisions will
   be able to consider the specific operation being performed (e.g.,
   update vs. read), the resource being accessed (e.g., a specific
   domain name), and potentially even attributes within the resource.

   Here solutions like OAuth2 RAR [RFC9396] could be considered to
   provide fine-grained access control.

5.1.2.  Resource Addressing

   RPP resources are addressed using URLs.  Considerations include:

   *  Hierarchical URL structure to represent resources of different
      type (e.g., /domains/{domain-name}, /contacts/{contact-id}).

   *  URL structure to represent list of related resources (e.g.,
      /domains/{domain-name}/contacts/)

   RPP URL structure will be designed to be human-readable, intuitive,
   and RESTful, allowing clients to easily navigate and interact with
   resources.

   RPP would not require all URLs to be hard wired to server's RPP root
   URL.  Instead, it would allow for relative URLs to be defined and
   discovered by the client.  This would allow servers to distibute
   resources across multiple servers and URLs and allow for easier
   scaling.

   As a matter of extensibility consideration RPP should allow for
   additional path segments to be added to the URLs and be discoverable
   by clients.

Internet-Draft              rpp-architecture                  March 2025


5.1.2.1.  Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)

   RPP will address the handling of Internationalized Domain Names
   (IDNs) in resource addressing.  Specifications will define whether to
   use IDN or UTF-8 encoding directly in URLs and whether to employ
   redirects to canonical URLs or "see-also" linking for alternative
   representations.  For example, a "see-also" link could point from a
   UTF-8 encoded URL to an IDN URL and vice versa, allowing clients to
   use either URL.  Another way would be to always redirect to the
   canonical URL, which would be the IDN URL.

5.1.3.  Mapping of basic operations to HTTP uniform interface (verbs)

   RPP operations are mapped to standard HTTP methods to leverage the
   uniform interface and RESTful principles:

   *  *GET:* Retrieve resource state (e.g., retrieving domain or contact
      information) - EPP info command

   *  *POST:* Create a new resource (e.g., registering a domain or
      create contact object) - EPP create command

   *  *PUT:* Update an existing resource in its entirety (e.g., updating
      domain registration details) - not 100% equivalent of EPP update
      command

   *  *DELETE:* Delete a resource (e.g., deleting a domain registration)
      - EPP delete command

   *  *PATCH:* Partially modify a resource (e.g., updating specific
      attributes of a domain or contact) - EPP update command

   EPP transfer commands (query and transform), being in fact a
   representation of a running process, may be modelled by a subresource
   /transfer of the resource being transferred, with a PUT operation to
   initiate the transfer, GET operation to query the transfer status and
   POST operation to approve or reject the transfer.  The same approach
   may apply when adding any other process to the resource, like domain
   restore.

   EPP check command may be modelled either as a GET operation with a
   dedicated media type, a POST operation with Expect header or a HEAD
   verb - depending on the specific requirements of the check operation.

Internet-Draft              rpp-architecture                  March 2025


   Other transform operations like renew, or restore which are not
   addressable resources in terms of REST may be either also modelled as
   POST requests with a dedicated media type, or be a convention of URLs
   with processing resources with only POST interface starting with
   underscore, e.g. /domains/{domain-name}/_renew.

   This basic set of rules and guidelines will be further refined in the
   RPP specifications and give an universal toolset for extending RPP
   with new resources and commands.

5.1.4.  RPP specific error codes and relation to HTTP error codes

   RPP utilizes both HTTP status codes and RPP-specific error codes
   within the response body for detailed error reporting.

   *  Use of HTTP status codes to indicate general categories of errors
      (e.g., 2xx success responses, 4xx for client errors, 5xx for
      server errors) [RFC7231].

   *  Use of additional signalling already standardised for HTTP, for
      example for rate limiting

   *  Definition of RPP-specific error codes, warnings of additional
      processing information, provided in the response, preferably
      outside of resource representation (e.g. in HTTP Headers) to give
      granular information about provisioning errors.

   *  Categorization of RPP error codes as temporary or permanent to
      guide client retry behavior.

5.1.5.  Transaction tracing and idempotency

   RPP shall support identification of requests and reponses on both
   client side and server side with use of client provided identifiers
   and server provided identifiers.  This will allow for tracking of
   requests and responses in case of errors, and for idempotency of
   requests.  This should be defined outside of the Data Representation
   Layer (e.g. as HTTP Headers), to assure clear separation of resourse
   representation from performed actions.  If possible existing
   mechanisms of HTTP shall be employed.

5.1.6.  Caching

   RPP shall benefit from HTTP standard caching mechanisms to enable
   standard components like proxies and caches to improve performance
   and reduce load on servers.  RPP shall define caching policies for
   different resources and operations, including cache-control headers
   and ETag support.

5.1.7.  Content negotiation for media types

   RPP supports content negotiation to allow clients to specify
   preferred media types for request and response payloads using the
   HTTP 'Accept' and 'Content-Type' headers [RFC7231].

   *  Support for 'application/rpp+json' as the primary media type.

   *  Potential support for other media types defined in the Data
      Representation Layer

5.1.7.1.  Prefer Header for Response Verbosity

   RPP may utilize the HTTP Prefer header [RFC7240] with the "return"
   preference to allow clients to control the verbosity of responses.
   For example, clients not interested in full resource representations
   could use Prefer: return=minimal to request minimal responses,
   reducing payload sizes and improving efficiency.  The default
   behavior, without the Prefer header, would be to return a full
   resource representation, similar to object info responses in EPP,
   especially after compound requests are completed.

5.1.8.  Language negotiation for textual content

   RPP shall support language negotiation to enable clients to request
   responses in a preferred language using the HTTP 'Accept-Language'
   header [RFC7231].

   *  Server implementations MAY support multiple languages for textual
      content in responses to provide human-readable localized
      responses.

   *  The default language and mechanisms for indicating supported
      languages will be defined, preferably using HTTP methods, like
      OPTIONS or HEAD requests.

   *  application/rpp+json media type may support multi-language
      representations, especially for witing operations involving user
      provided content.  Other media types may have different mechanisms
      for language representation.

5.1.9.  Definition of special resources

   RPP may define special resources for specific purposes:

   *  Service Discovery endpoints to advertise protocol capabilities and
      supported features (see Section 5.1.10).

Internet-Draft              rpp-architecture                  March 2025


   *  Metadata endpoints to provide schema information or other
      protocol-level metadata, potentially including OpenAPI definitions
      for documentation and code generation.

5.1.10.  Service discovery mechanisms

   RPP will define mechanisms for service discovery, allowing clients to
   dynamically discover RPP service endpoints and capabilities, reducing
   coupling between clients and servers.

   *  Potential use of well-known URIs (e.g., /.well-known/rpp-
      capabilities) for service discovery.

   *  Options for advertising supported protocol versions, extensions,
      available resource types, authentication methods, and supported
      features.

   *  It may be considered for RPP to distribute service discovery for
      each resource type separately for better scalability and
      management.  For example instead of having a single service
      discovery endpoint for the whole registry on /.well-known/rpp-
      capabilities there might be a separate discovery placed under
      /{resource-type}/.well-known/rpp-capabilities e.g. /domains/.well-
      known/rpp-capabilities.

   *  Service discovery shall utilize standardised methods, like URI
      templates [RFC6570] to allow easy navigation of resources and
      avoid hard-coding of URLs.

5.2.  Data Representation Layer

   This layer focuses on the encapsulation and data representation of
   RPP messages.  It defines the media type used to carry RPP data and
   supports various data representation formats.

5.2.1.  Data structure

   RPP will define the overall structure of the message payload carried
   by the chosen media type.  Options for the data structure include:

   *  *'rpp' Structure:* Defining a new, dedicated data structure
      specifically for RPP messages.  This would be the default in core
      specifications.

   *  *'epp' Structure Adaptation:* Reusing the existing EPP XML
      schemas, to maintain data model compatibility with EPP core
      objects and simplify mapping from EPP.

Internet-Draft              rpp-architecture                  March 2025


   *  *'vc' Structure Leverage:* Utilizing Verifiable Credentials data
      structures where appropriate, especially for representing identity
      or authorization information.

5.2.2.  Data format and encapsulation

   The primary encapsulation for RPP data represetations shall be JSON,
   however RPP should be able to support extensions to support other
   formats like XML, JWT, JWT-SD or CBOR.

   *  *Plain JSON:* Standard JSON format [RFC8259] for simplicity and
      broad compatibility.

   *  *XML:* Extensible Markup Language [XML] (considered for potential
      compatibility).

   *  *JWT:* JSON data encapsulated within a JSON Web Token [RFC7519]
      for potential use-cases when verifiable data consistency is
      required

   *  *JWT-SD:* JSON data with Selective Disclosure using JWTs
      [I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt] for minimisation
      of exposed data.

   *  *CBOR:* Concise Binary Object Representation for specific use
      cases requiring compact binary encoding.

   Change of encapsulation shall not affect the data structure, which
   should be defined independently of the encapsulation.

5.2.3.  Media Type definition

   Together encapsulation and data structure would define the whole
   media type.  So application/rpp+json would be the primary media type
   with "rpp" payloads in plain json format. application/epp+xml would
   be epp payload as per [RFC5730].  The Encapsulation and Data
   Structure can be also othewise combined as far as it is possible to
   represent the Data Structure in a given encapsulation.  For example
   it would be straightforward to represent "rpp" structure in JWT
   format and application/rpp+jwt Media Type, but in order to represent
   epp structure in JWT format it would require first a mapping of epp
   messages on JSON instead of XML - rendering application/epp+jwt Media
   Type.

5.3.  Resource Definition Layer

   Each resource type, no matter if on a top level, being an independent
   provisioning object, or a subresource, being a part of another
   resource, shall be well defined including data elements and possible
   operations.  A respource definition shall on the first level of
   abstraction be composable out of data elements, without any reference
   to the media type or representation.  This will allow for easy
   extensibility and compatibility with different media types.

   All resource types shall be defined in IANA registry in a way that
   allows fully automated processing of the resource definition,
   including data elements, operations and media type representation.

5.3.1.  Data Elements

   This part defines logical data elements for each resource type, which
   can also be re-used across resource types.  It is abstracted from the
   actual transport and media type, focusing on the structure and
   constraints of data elements.  Data element definition includes:

   *  Identification of logical data units (e.g. a stable identifier of
      a data element, which is independent of the representation)

   *  Definition of logical data units (e.g., domain name, contact
      details)

   *  Format and schema for primitive data elements or reference to
      other resource type definitions

   *  Constraints on data elements (e.g., data type, length, allowed
      values)

   *  Mechanisms for extensibility, if applicable

   Data elements shall be defined in IANA registry in a way that allows
   for automated processing of the data element definition, including
   constraints and references to other data elements.

5.3.2.  Mapping

   This layer defines the mapping of Data Elements onto the Data
   Representation Layer.  For example in case of application/rpp+json
   media type, the mapping layer would define how the logical data units
   are represented in JSON format.

Internet-Draft              rpp-architecture                  March 2025


   This additional level of indirection would allow usage of data
   formats defined outside of rpp specifications - for example usage of
   Verifiable Credentials or Verifiable Presentations as first class
   resource types for contacts in RPP, and mapping appropriate data
   elements.

   The mapping layer shall be defined in IANA registry in a way that
   allows for automated processing of the mapping definition, including
   reading and writing operations.  Mechanisms, such as defined for
   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Patch [RFC6902], may be used to
   define the mapping.

5.3.3.  Operations

   Each resource type shall define operations possible on this resource
   type.  This may encompass any of the mechanism defined on the HTTP
   transport layer and be constrained by those extensibility rules.

   Operations shall be defined in IANA registry in a way that allows for
   automated processing of the operation definition, including
   constraints and references to other resource types.

   FIXME: find an appropriate section for this * Compatibility Profiles
   - to define subsets of RPP for specific use cases or EPP
   compatibility.
